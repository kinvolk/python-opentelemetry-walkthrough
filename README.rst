MicroDonuts: An OpenTracing Walkthrough
=======================================


Welcome to MicroDonuts! This is a sample application and OpenTracing
walkthrough, written in Python.

OpenTracing is a vendor-neutral, open standard for distributed tracing. To
learn more, check out [opentracing.io](http://opentracing.io), and try the
walkthrough below!

**Note that there are two git branches of note here.**
- `git checkout master` illustrates a trivial multi-service app with cross-service tracing via OpenTracing
- `git checkout no-tracing` removes the tracing instrumentation, allowing the reader to add it in themselves

Step 0: Setup MicroDonuts
=========================

Getting it
----------

#. Install `virtualenv`: `sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv`
#. Create a virtual environment: `mkdir microdonuts; virtualenv microdonuts`
#. Activate the virtual environment: `source microdonuts/bin/activate`
#. Clone this repository
#. Install the dependencies `pip3 install -r python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/requirements.txt`

Running
-------

#. `pyhton3 python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/walkthrough/server.py`
#. Open your web browser, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:10001` and order yourself some Âµ-donuts.

MicroDonuts has 4 server endpoints:

#. `/order`
#. `/status`
#. `/kitchen/add_donuts`
#. `/kitchen/get_donuts`

The first 2 serve orders, the last 2 provide kitchen services.

Step 1: Check out the `no-tracing` branch
-----------------------------------------

The `master` branch in this repository has tracing instrumentation added as
described below. To maximize your learnings, do a...

.. code:: bash

    git checkout no-tracing

...to start with a version of the code that's not instrumented yet. The guide
below will let you learn-by-doing as you re-introduce that tracing
instrumentation.

Step 2: Turnkey Tracing
-----------------------

When you go to add tracing to a system, the best place to start is by
installing OpenTracing plugins for the OSS components you are using.
Instrumenting your networking libraries, web frameworks, and service clients
quickly gives you a lot of information about your distributed system, without
requiring you to change a lot of code.

To do this, let's change the startup of the application to include tracing:
`cd python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/walkthrough`

Start the global tracer
.......................

In OpenTracing, there is a concept of a global tracer for everyone to access.

Accessing this global tracer is easy, just add these lines to `server.py` under
`BLOCK 0`:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry import trace, propagators
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import Tracer
    from opentelemetry.sdk.context.propagation.b3_format import B3Format

Add these lines under `BLOCK 1` too:

.. code:: python

    trace.set_preferred_tracer_implementation(lambda T: Tracer())

    propagators.set_global_httptextformat(B3Format())

    tracer = trace.tracer()

The global tracer is now available as `tracer`.


Instrument the HTTP requests
............................

This is done in an automatic way by just adding this line under `BLOCK 0`:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.ext.http_requests import enable

Add also this line under `BLOCK 1`:

.. code:: python

    enable(tracer)

Instrument Flask
................

This example uses Flask to expose the HTTP endpoints. Flask code can
be traced automatically by adding this line under `BLOCK 0`:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.ext.wsgi import OpenTelemetryMiddleware

Add this line under `BLOCK 2` also:

.. code:: python

    app.wsgi_app = OpenTelemetryMiddleware(app.wsgi_app)

Add an exporter
...............

An exporter is necessary for the span data to be displayed. We'll use the
`ConsoleExporter` in this example, an exporter that simply prints the span data
into the console. Add these lines under `BLOCK 0`:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleExportSpanProcessor

Add this line under `BLOCK 1`:

.. code:: python

    tracer.add_span_processor(
        SimpleExportSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
    )


Step 3: Have fun
----------------

You can run the walkthrough again as explained before. You should see the span
data displayed in the console.

Thanks for playing, and welcome to OpenTelemetry!
